# thesis_replication_material

This repository includes the python scripts for the following: cross-validation, forecasting, making the data set, a list of the different experiments, the configure file, the experimental procedure, and implementation of the machine learning models.

Also included are the R scripts used for the exploration and analysis of the data.

All scripts were gathered from the scripts from Bluwstein et al, 2021, and revised to fit our problem.

I used Jupyter notebook to interact with the python scripts, turning the experiment files into .ipynb files.
I used RStudio for all the R analysis of the results.
